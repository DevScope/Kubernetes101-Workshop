# Dotnet Tye Intro Hands-On-Lab

This lab is composed by 3 exercises:

* [Running .NET applications locally using Tye in an integrated environment](hello-tye/00_run_locally.md)
* [Deploying applications to a Kubernetes cluster quickly and easily](hello-tye/01_deploy.md)
* [Adding external services needed by the system and deploying them to a Kubernetes cluster](hello-tye/03_add_redis.md)

Tye is yet a beta project, but with great capabilities and features that will allow it to grow its popularity faster among developers.

In the `hello-tye` folder there's three exercises using Tye, plus a folder called `docs` which is some documentation powered by Microsoft.
